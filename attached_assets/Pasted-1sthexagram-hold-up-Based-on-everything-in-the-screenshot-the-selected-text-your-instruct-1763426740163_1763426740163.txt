1sthexagram — **hold up.**
Based on everything in the screenshot + the selected text + your instructions **DO NOT IMPLEMENT ANYTHING WITHOUT MY APPROVAL**, here's the correct move:

---

# ✅ **NO — do NOT proceed with the fix yet.

You need to verify something first.**

Because based on the exact code you pasted:

```ts
const config = (sectionConfig as any)[metricId];
if (!config || !metricsData) return null;
```

…it is **literally impossible** for cross-group bleed to produce extra metric cards.
Extra cards would only appear if:

### **A. The selectedMetrics array contains more than 3 items**

or

### **B. The sectionConfig object contains extra metric IDs that don’t belong to that section**

or

### **C. The tracks page is NOT actually using renderMetricsSection('tracks')**

or

### **D. Another component, above or below, is ALSO rendering metric cards**

(this is the most likely)

This is why you’re still seeing all 9 cards.

**Your current hypothesis is NOT confirmed yet.
The agent jumped too quickly.**

---

# 🔥 BEFORE approving any fix, you need ONE diagnostic:

Paste the FULL **rendered HTML** of the `/tracks` metrics container.

The screenshot you couldn’t upload earlier is what we need.
Since you can’t upload images here:

### **Please run this in the browser console on the `/tracks` page:**

```js
Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('[data-testid^="stats-card"]')).map(el => el.innerText)
```

OR, if you don’t have test IDs:

```js
Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.stats-card')).map(el => el.innerText)
```

### Paste the result here.

This will show exactly:

* Which metric cards are being rendered
* Which metric IDs they correspond to
* Whether they are grouped or not
* Whether a second renderer is outputting them

---

# 🔍 Why I’m asking for this

Because based on your pasted `renderMetricsSection` code:

* It returns **null** for any metric ID that does not exist in the selected section.
* It only loops over `selectedMetrics` (3 items max).
* It only pulls from `METRIC_CARD_CONFIG[sectionKey]`.

So it **cannot** produce 9 metrics unless something else is rendering them.

This means:

### ❗ There is another component (legacy, shared, or layout-level)

…that is rendering ALL 9 metrics **outside of renderMetricsSection**.

**This must be confirmed before applying any changes.**

If you skip this step and apply the guard fix, you will still have the wrong UI.

---

# ⭐ So your answer right now should be:

**“Do NOT implement the fix yet — first collect the output of that console command so we can identify the true source.”**

Just reply with the console output, and I’ll identify the exact file + line number causing the duplicate/bleed-through rendering.
