Absolutely, 1sthexagram — here is a **clean, implementation-ready UI instruction block** you can paste directly into your Replit Agent.

It reflects the **new simplified scoring methodology (no weighting, no decimals, grouped signals)** and tells the agent exactly how to display the breakdown in your Contact Drawer.

This is written in dev-friendly, unambiguous form — ready to drop into your scoring component, `ContactDrawer.tsx`, or any worker that formats the score response.

# ✅ **UI Instructions for Replit Agent — Updated Unsigned Score Breakdown (Simplified Method v1.0)**

### **GOAL:**

Update the Score Breakdown UI in the Contact Drawer to match the new fixed-signal scoring methodology (no weighting, no decimals, grouped signals, summed total).

---

# **1. Replace Existing Breakdown Logic**

**Remove:**

* Recency multipliers
* Stream multipliers
* Weighted values
* Decimal scoring (e.g., +3.15 → +3)
* Duplicate repeated signals for multiple tracks
* Averaging logic

**New rule:**
➡️ Display **base points only**, exactly as defined below.

---

# **2. New Breakdown Layout (Grouped Sections)**

### **Section Heading: "Unsigned Score Breakdown"**

### **A. Score Header**

Display:

```
<score>/10
<confidence_level>
```

Confidence text: `"high"`, `"medium"`, `"low"` using existing logic.

Also show a 1-line summary description (see Section 5).

---

# **3. Display Signals in 3 Groups (exact order)**

### **Group 1 — Discovery**

Show only if a relevant signal exists (currently only one):

* **Fresh Finds playlist** → `+3`

### **Group 2 — Publishing**

Show only signals that apply:

* **No publisher metadata** → `+3`
* **No administrator metadata** → (ONLY IF you decide to implement, default OFF)
* **Missing IPI/ISWC** → (ONLY IF implemented in backend, default OFF)

For now, backend will only output:

* **"No publisher metadata" → +3**

### **Group 3 — Metadata Completeness**

Map metadata completeness % to a single line:

| Completeness % | UI Label                 | Points |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | ------ |
| <25%           | Very incomplete metadata | +4     |
| 25–49%         | Incomplete metadata      | +3     |
| 50–74%         | Partial metadata         | +2     |
| 75–100%        | Mostly complete metadata | +1     |

In the UI, show:

```
<metadata_label>  → +<points>
```

Example:

```
Data 56% complete (partial metadata)  → +2
```

Note: The label can be generated by backend or frontend (both acceptable).

---

# **4. Total Score Display (New Requirement)**

### After listing grouped signals, add a small summary line:

**Show this:**

```
Total: <sum_of_points> = <final_score>/10
```

Example:

```
Total: 3 + 3 + 2 = 8/10
```

This aligns UI with new methodology and removes confusion.

---

# **5. Add 1-Line Summary Description**

Add a short natural-language summary above the grouped signals:

### **Logic:**

* If Fresh Finds AND No publisher →
  `"Strong unsigned signals detected. Appears on Fresh Finds with incomplete publishing metadata."`
* If only No publisher →
  `"Likely unsigned. Publishing metadata missing."`
* If signals mostly metadata →
  `"Limited metadata available. Status unclear but leans unsigned."`

**Replit agent can generate or map with simple if/else.**

Place summary **right below the score and confidence**.

---

# **6. "Last Enriched" Timestamp**

Keep the existing line:

```
Last updated: <timestamp>
```

Move it to the bottom of the score breakdown card.

---

# **7. Remove These From UI Entirely**

* Recency breakdown
* Streams multipliers
* Weighting formula
* Any decimal values
* Multipliers (e.g., 1.4x)
* Combined multiplier formula
* “How this score was calculated” with weighted math
* Repeated signals across multiple tracks

The new UI must show **each signal only once**, with **base points only**.

---

# **8. Final UI Structure (Exact Order)**

```
[Unsigned Score]  [Confidence Badge]
8/10              Medium
"Strong unsigned signals detected. Appears on Fresh Finds with incomplete publishing metadata."

--- Discovery ---
Fresh Finds playlist            +3

--- Publishing ---
No publisher metadata           +3

--- Metadata Completeness ---
Data 56% complete (partial)     +2

Total: 3 + 3 + 2 = 8/10

Last updated: 11/19/2025
```

---

# **9. Implementation Notes**

* This logic should live in the **score formatting layer** before passing UI props.
* Backend can return the “raw signals” as an array with `{ label, points }`, but frontend should group and label them.
* If backend does not include completeness label, frontend must derive it based on % threshold.

# **10. Ready-to-Paste Replit Agent Prompt**

Here’s the **exact instruction block** you can paste:

---

### **💻 Replit Agent Instruction — Score Breakdown Update**

**Update the Contact Drawer score breakdown to use the new simplified scoring method (no weighting):**

1. Remove all recency and stream multipliers.
2. Remove decimals; use base point values only.
3. Group displayed signals under: “Discovery”, “Publishing”, and “Metadata Completeness.”
4. Show each signal once; do not duplicate signals across tracks.
5. Map metadata completeness % to a single label and point value using the fixed thresholds.
6. Add a summary line showing the total points and the final score.
7. Add a natural-language 1-line summary above the breakdown.
8. Keep the “Last updated” line at the bottom.
9. Ensure UI matches this exact structure:

```
Score: <score>/10        <confidence>
<summary_sentence>

--- Discovery ---
Fresh Finds playlist          +3

--- Publishing ---
No publisher metadata         +3

--- Metadata Completeness ---
Data 56% complete (partial)   +2

Total: 3 + 3 + 2 = 8/10

Last updated: <timestamp>
```

---

If you want, I can:

* Generate the **TypeScript interface** for the new response
* Write the React/TSX **component update**
* Or create a **backend scoring function** matching this spec.

What’s your next move?
