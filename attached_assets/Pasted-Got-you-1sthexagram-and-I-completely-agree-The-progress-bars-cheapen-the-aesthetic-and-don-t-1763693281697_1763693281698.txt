Got you, 1sthexagram — and I completely agree.
**The progress bars cheapen the aesthetic** and don’t match the CreateSafe / PubCo design language.
They make the scoring system feel like a fitness tracker instead of an A&R intelligence tool.

Let’s fix it.

Below are **four much better UI alternatives** — all clean, premium, and aligned with the new weighted-category model.

---

# ✅ **Option 1 — Pill Badges (Cleanest & Most Professional)**

Remove bars entirely and put the category score inside a tight badge.

### Example:

```
Publishing Status        [4.0 / 4 pts]
No publisher metadata across all tracks
```

### Layout:

* Category title (bold)
* Small grey subheading
* Badge on the right (light grey or blue)
* List of contributing signals below it

### Why this is great:

* Minimalist
* Fits with the rest of your design
* Easy to scan
* Looks *premium*

---

# ✅ **Option 2 — Vertical Score Blocks (Luxury Data Aesthetic)**

Replace progress bars with a simple left-edge vertical bar.

### Example:

| Category          | Score            |
| ----------------- | ---------------- |
| Publishing Status | **▮▮▮▮** (4.0/4) |

It functions like a very subtle “intensity indicator.”

### Why this works:

* Much cleaner
* Feels like a professional analytics platform
* No “playful” visual language

---

# ✅ **Option 3 — Category Cards With Simple Number Indicators**

Just show strong numeric alignment — no bars, no distraction.

### Example:

**Publishing Status**
Score: **4.0 / 4**
✓ No publisher metadata across all tracks

**Early Career Signals**
Score: **2.0 / 2**
✓ Fresh Finds placement

This is extremely readable and matches investor-grade scoring aesthetics.

---

# ✅ **Option 4 — Radar Chart (Optional, Advanced)**

A single visual at the top showing category contribution on a hexagon.

This is optional but sexy for A&R and external-facing dashboards.

# 🎨 **My Recommended Final Layout (Best Match for Your App)**

Replace progress bars with the Category Score Badge + Clean Layout:

---

## **Category Card Example (Final Version)**

**Publishing Status**
**Score: 4.0 / 4 pts**

* No publisher metadata across all tracks

---

**Release Pathway**
**Score: 0.0 / 3 pts**

* None detected

---

**Early Career Signals**
**Score: 2.0 / 2 pts**

* Appears on Fresh Finds playlist

---

**Metadata Quality**
**Score: 0.5 / 1 pts**

* Average completeness: 56%

---

**Catalog Patterns**
**Score: 0.0 / 0.5 pts**

---

**Profile Verification**
**Score: 0.0 / 0.5 pts**

---

### Why this layout works:

* Zero clutter
* Purely textual
* Elegant
* Executive-grade readability
* Zero “gamer” or “fitness app” vibes
* Matches the dark UI styling and your product’s professional identity
