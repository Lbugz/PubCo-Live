Overall polish priorities
The three detail drawers were built independently and now use different visual hierarchies, padding, and status patterns (compare the playlist hero/timeline inside playlists-view.tsx, the dense track drawer inside details-drawer.tsx, and the contact drawer in contact-detail-drawer.tsx).

To make them feel like one system, introduce shared primitives: a DetailDrawerHeader (cover art, title, curator/artist badges), a StatsGrid (up to four KPI cards), an ActionRail (primary CTA + secondary actions), and an EnrichmentTimeline component. Each drawer can pass its own data, but spacing, typography, and badge styles stay identical.

Playlist drawer
Hero & stats alignment – The playlist drawer uses a hero art block with an overlapping Card, but the content depends on absolute positioning and mixes mx-4, -mt-16, and p-4, which gives it a different rhythm than the other drawers.
Replace the bespoke layout with the shared header component so all drawers share the same padding, badge styles, and title typography.

Accordion sprawl – Metadata, analytics, actions, and history all sit inside a large accordion with inconsistent default states, making it harder to scan quickly.
Break the accordion into two consistently ordered sections (“Metadata & Ownership”, “Activity & Enrichment”) and use secondary headings with dividers instead of nested accordions to reduce visual noise.

Timeline duplication – The enrichment timeline logic mirrors what the track drawer already renders, but with slightly different copy and badge thresholds.
Extract a PipelineStatus component so playlist and track drawers show identical step visuals, colors, and completion logic.

Track drawer
Hero block density – The track drawer hero mixes album art, metadata badges, and action buttons in one Card, so users have to parse multiple groups at once.
Adopt the shared header to separate identity (art/title/badges) from actions, and add a subdued surface for the CTA row so it mirrors playlist/contact actions.

Tabs + accordions overload – Songwriters/producers are shown via tabs that reveal accordion lists, which then hold publisher, stage, social, notes, and tags—all inside the same component tree.
Move publisher/stage/tags out into a dedicated “Credits” section so the songwriters accordion only handles person records; flatten producers into the same component to avoid two different tab experiences.

Redundant badges & inconsistent states – Score/status badges repeat with different colors in multiple locations (header, accordion rows, enrichment timeline), and empty states vary (“Enrich to discover socials” vs. skeleton vs. cards).
Centralize badge variants (e.g., score, verification) and adopt one empty-state component with icon + label copy to standardize the feel.

Contact drawer
Header hierarchy – Contacts only render a title, stage badge, and hot-lead badge inside SheetHeader, so there’s no cover/identity element or curator imagery to match the playlist/track drawers.
Use the shared header component with either initials-based avatar or songwriter photo, plus stage/hot lead badges, so it visually matches the others.

Quick actions lacking wiring + icons – Email/DM/Re-Enrich buttons don’t carry any metadata (no tooltips, disabled states, or contact info), so they feel placeholder-y.
Populate each action with actual data (mailto links, messenger handles, enrichment status) and reuse the same ActionRail styling as the track drawer.

Placeholder social + activity blocks – Social links are static buttons that ignore whatever the contact actually stores, and the timeline tab only shows two dummy cards and a “coming soon” state.
Bind the social section to contact fields, display icons only when data exists, and leverage the shared timeline component (same pill, timestamp, copy) to keep the experience consistent.

Standardization checklist
Shared layout tokens – Apply p-6/gap-4 spacing, rounded-xl surfaces, and consistent border opacity so all drawers reflect the same design system.

Typography & metadata – Use text-xs uppercase section labels, text-lg font-semibold sub-headings, and keep metadata chips at the same size/weight.

Interaction patterns – Adopt the same hover/focus/disabled states on all action buttons; align tab styles (equal-width triggers with progress indicators) and empty states (icon + heading + helper text).

Component extraction – Promote the duplicated patterns (timeline, stats cards, person list rows) into shared components under client/src/components/details/ to remove divergence and make future refinements (like dark mode adjustments) a single change.

Following these adjustments will unify the Playlist, Track, and Contact drawers without rewriting their data logic, giving the product a cohesive, production-ready feel.
