Here’s an evaluation of the existing “top metrics” cards on each page and how well they align with your new songwriter‑oriented scoring rubric, followed by concrete suggestions for improvement.

## 🎵 Playlist View – Existing Metrics

| Metric Card                      | Current Purpose                                                                                   | Alignment with Songwriter Scoring | Comments                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Total Tracked** (`22`)         | Counts total playlists under management.                                                          | Neutral                           | Useful for operations but does not reveal any songwriter‑specific insights.                                                 |
| **Unique Songwriters** (`884`)   | Counts distinct songwriter names across all tracked playlists.                                    | Moderate                          | Gives a sense of catalog breadth, but doesn’t surface whether those writers are unsigned or missing publishers.             |
| **High‑Impact Playlists** (`15`) | Highlights playlists meeting “High‑Impact” threshold (likely driven by artist‑centric algorithm). | Misaligned                        | This likely uses the old artist scoring; it doesn’t identify playlists rich in unsigned songwriters or self‑written tracks. |

### 📌 Recommendations

* **Replace “High‑Impact Playlists” with a songwriter metric.**
  For example, surface playlists where ≥X% of tracks have *missing publisher* or *missing writer* metadata. These lists are prime fishing grounds for publishing A&R.

* **Introduce an “Unsigned Songwriters in Playlists” card.**
  Show the total number of distinct songwriters in your playlist universe who have no publisher listed. This directly ties to your highest‑priority signal (missingPublisher).

* **Add a “Self‑Written Tracks Count” card.**
  Highlight how many self‑written tracks appear in your tracked playlists (artist = songwriter). Those songwriters are easier to approach and should be prioritized.

## 🎧 Tracks View – Existing Metrics

| Metric Card                | Current Purpose                             | Alignment with Songwriter Scoring | Comments                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Deal‑Ready Tracks** (0)  | Flag tracks ready for outreach.             | Unclear                           | Appears to use the older artist rubric (e.g., Fresh Finds + indie label). Needs songwriter‑specific thresholds. |
| **Avg Unsigned Score** (0) | Average of scoring algorithm across tracks. | Misaligned                        | If this uses the old artist‑based scoring, it’s no longer meaningful.                                           |
| **Enriched Tracks** (0)    | Tracks with fully enriched metadata.        | Neutral                           | Useful operationally but doesn’t reflect new prioritization logic.                                              |

### 📌 Recommendations

* **Recompute “Avg Score” using the songwriter rubric.**
  Rename it to “Avg Songwriter Score” and calculate based on your new `RUBRIC` (missingPublisher, missingWriter, artistIsWriter_FreshFinds, etc.). This will give an accurate measure of catalog potential.

* **Define “Deal‑Ready” threshold for songwriters.**
  For example, classify any track with a score ≥7 as deal‑ready (missing publisher + any other bonus). Update the card to show the count of such tracks.

* **Replace “Enriched Tracks” with “Missing Publisher Tracks”.**
  Count how many tracks lack publisher data. This is your single strongest signal; seeing the volume of opportunity at a glance will help A&R prioritize.

* **Optional: Add a “Velocity Hot List” card.**
  Show how many tracks have week‑over‑week stream growth >20%. Combined with missing publisher, this helps your team act fast on rising songs.

## 👥 Contacts (Contact Workspace) – Existing Metrics

| Metric Card             | Current Purpose                                       | Alignment with Songwriter Scoring | Comments                                                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Total Pipeline** (0)  | Total contacts in the A&R pipeline.                   | Neutral                           | Good basic metric, but doesn’t highlight songwriter opportunity.                             |
| **Hot Leads** (0)       | Likely counts contacts flagged as ready for outreach. | Unclear                           | If based on old scoring or manual flags, it may not reflect updated criteria.                |
| **Avg. WoW Growth** (—) | Average week‑over‑week stream growth of contacts.     | Neutral                           | Velocity is useful, but only meaningful when combined with missing publisher/writer signals. |

### 📌 Recommendations

* **Re‑define “Hot Leads” using the new scoring threshold.**
  E.g., label contacts as “Hot” when any of their tracks score ≥8 (missing publisher + self‑written + velocity). This ensures your CRM highlights the most attractive songwriter leads.

* **Add a “Unsigned Songwriters in Pipeline” card.**
  Track the number (and percentage) of contacts whose songs lack publisher data. This aligns with your primary business objective and helps manage funnel coverage.

* **Surface “Avg Songwriter Score” for pipeline contacts.**
  Use the new rubric to compute an average score for each contact (across all their compositions) and display the mean value across the pipeline. This provides a quick health check of the pipeline quality.

* **Keep “Avg. WoW Growth” but contextualize it.**
  Pair it with the count of unsigned songwriters experiencing >20% growth, so you can focus outreach where momentum and opportunity intersect.

## 🎯 Overall Guidance

1. **Shift from artist‑centric metrics to songwriter‑centric metrics.**
   The core signals (missing publisher, missing writer, self‑written, indie + self‑written, and stream velocity) should directly inform every “top metric” card.

2. **Use threshold‑based tiers.**
   Adopt your new scoring thresholds (e.g., ≥7 = high priority) for labeling “High Impact” or “Deal Ready” items across playlists, tracks, and contacts.

3. **Highlight opportunities, not just inventory.**
   Metrics like “total tracked” and “total pipeline” are helpful operationally, but for A&R you want to know where the *opportunities* lie — missing publisher, incomplete metadata, fast‑growing compositions.

By refocusing the top metric cards around these songwriter‑specific signals, your dashboard will better serve the publishing A&R workflow and help prioritize outreach efforts effectively.
