1sthexagram — **YES, this score is mathematically impossible given the signals shown.**
Your UI is showing:

### **+4 + +4 + +3 + +3 + +2 = 16 → but the score is capped at 10.**

That means the **backend is correctly capping scores**,
BUT the **frontend is showing WRONG weight values**.

This is a **frontend bug**, not a scoring logic bug.

Let me break it down clearly:

---

# 🔥 **WHY THIS IS HAPPENING**

Your current **production scoring weights** are:

| Signal                          | Actual Weight |
| ------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Fresh Finds                     | **+3**        |
| No publisher metadata           | **+3**        |
| DIY distributor                 | **+2**        |
| Metadata completeness “partial” | **+2**        |
| Unsigned distribution pattern   | **+2**        |

But your **UI is displaying**:

* Fresh Finds → **+4** ❌ wrong
* No publisher → **+4** ❌ wrong
* DIY distributor → **+3** ❌ wrong
* Data completeness → **+3** ❌ wrong
* Portfolio DIY → **+2** ✔ correct

So the signal weights in your UI **do NOT match** the production scoring engine.

This is why the visual breakdown sums to **16**, but the score shows **10**.

The backend correctly clamps total → min(10, max(0, sum)).

---

# 🎯 **THE ROOT CAUSE**

During your old weighted model:

* Fresh Finds was +3 * 1.4 = **~4.2**
* No publisher was +3 * 1.4 = **~4.2**
* DIY was +2 * 1.3 = **~2.6**
* Data partial was +3 * 1.1 = **~3.3**

Your **UI still has the old weighted values cached** or displayed from legacy logic.

But your **backend has been updated to use simplified fixed weights**.

So your UI and backend are out of sync.

---

# 🩹 **PROOF: BACKEND WEIGHTS vs UI WEIGHTS**

### **Backend (Correct) → from your scoring code audit**

* FRESH_FINDS = **3**
* NO_PUBLISHER = **3**
* DIY = **2**
* COMPLETENESS_50_75 = **2**
* UNSIGNED_DISTRIBUTION_PATTERN = **2**

### **Frontend (Wrong) → from screenshot**

* Fresh Finds = **4** ❌
* No publisher = **4** ❌
* DIY = **3** ❌
* Completeness = **3** ❌
* Portfolio = **2** ✔

---

# ✔️ **HERE’S THE FIX YOU NEED TO TELL REPLIT TO MAKE**

You must update your frontend scoring breakdown renderer to use the **base weights** from the backend instead of legacy weighted values.

---

### **REPLIT FIX INSTRUCTION (Copy/Paste)**

```
Please update the ScoreBreakdown component so that all displayed signal weights reflect the 
actual weight values returned by contactScoring.ts.

Do NOT use hardcoded or legacy weighted values.

Specifically:
- Replace any instance of +4 (Fresh Finds) with +3
- Replace any instance of +4 (No publisher) with +3
- Replace any instance of +3 (DIY distributor) with +2
- Replace any instance of +3 (Data completeness partial) with +2

The UI should always display the `weight` value returned directly from the backend scoring engine.
No client-side recalculation should occur.

Also ensure tooltip / descriptions are synced to these weights.
```

---

# ⭐ **WHAT THE UI SHOULD SHOW FOR THIS CONTACT**

Correct breakdown:

```
Fresh Finds playlist       +3
No publisher metadata      +3
DIY distributor            +2
Data 56% (partial)         +2
DIY distribution pattern   +2

Total: 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 12
Final Score = 10/10 (capped)
```

Thus the backend is correct, but UI is showing wrong values.

---

# 🧠 **NEXT STEP**

If you want, I can:

* Regenerate the exact Scoring Tab UI using correct weights
* Generate a PR-ready patch for React/TypeScript
* Update the 1-pager to show the correct example sums
* Add a “score capped at 10” final line to prevent confusion

Just tell me **“update score UI spec”** or **“generate Replit patch.”**
