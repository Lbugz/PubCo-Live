1sthexagram — here is the **clean, authoritative summary** of *all* songwriter metrics your system currently supports, plus what’s missing and what should be added. This is structured for internal documentation, metrics dashboards, and dev team alignment.

# ✅ **Complete Songwriter Metrics in Your Codebase**

Below is the full taxonomy grouped by **Data Source**, **Current Usage**, and **Strategic Purpose**.
This reflects exactly what exists today in PubCo Live.

---

# **1. Core Count Metrics**

### **1. Total Songwriters (Contacts)**

* **Source:** `contacts`
* **Query:** `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM contacts`
* **Current Value:** 807
* **Use:** Base population of your publishing pipeline.

---

# **2. Publishing Status Metrics**

### **2. Unsigned Songwriters (No Publisher)**

* **Source:** `playlist_snapshots.publisher`
* **Logic:** `publisher IS NULL OR publisher = ''` **AND** `creditsStatus = 'success'`
* **Implementation:** `metricsService.ts → unsigned songwriters`
* **Use:** Identify publishing opportunities.

### **7. Songwriters by Publisher Status**

* **Source:** `playlist_snapshots.publisher_status`
* **Use:** Metadata from enrichment phases for deeper publishing insights.

---

# **3. Pipeline Stage Metrics (Funnel / CRM)**

### **3. Songwriters by Pipeline Stage**

* **Source:** `contacts.stage`
* **Stages & Criteria:**

  * **Discovery Pool:** <100K streams
  * **Watch List:** 100K–1M streams OR WoW > 20%
  * **Active Search:** >1M streams OR WoW > 50%

---

# **4. Data Quality & Coverage Metrics**

### **4. Songwriters with Stream Data**

* **Source:** `playlist_snapshots.spotify_streams`
* **Coverage:** ~35%
* **Use:** Indicator of enrichment completeness.

### **5. Songwriters with Contact Information**

* **Sources:** `playlist_snapshots`, `artists`
* **Fields:** Instagram, Twitter, Email, Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, Bandcamp, Website
* **Use:** Outreach-ready profiles.

---

# **5. Lead Scoring & Prioritization**

### **6. Deal-Ready Songwriters**

* **Source:** `metricsService.ts`
* **Logic:** `unsignedScore ≥ 7 AND email IS NOT NULL`
* **Note:**
  You're correct that **email as gating criteria is flawed**, because enrichment never provides email.
  This metric should be redefined to **score-only**, or replaced entirely.

---

# **6. Output, Popularity & Velocity Metrics**

### **9. Songwriters by Total Tracks**

* **Source:** `contacts.totalTracks`
* **Use:** Productivity indicator.

### **10. Songwriters by Total Streams**

* **Source:** `contacts.totalStreams`
* **Use:** Commercial footprint.

### **11. Songwriters with WoW Growth**

* **Source:** `contacts.wowGrowthPct`
* **Use:** Detect rising momentum.

---

# **7. Cross-Platform Identity Metrics**

### **12. Songwriters with Chartmetric IDs**

* **Source:** `songwriter_profiles.chartmetricId`
* **Use:** Analytics linking (cross-platform).

### **13. Songwriters by Top Publisher**

* **Source:** `songwriter_profiles.topPublisher`, `topPublisherWorks`
* **Use:** Publisher market share analysis.

---

# **8. Collaboration & Network Metrics**

### **14. Songwriters with Collaborations**

* **Source:** `songwriter_collaborations`
* **Metrics:**

  * Collaboration count
  * Frequency
  * Co-writer network graph
* **Use:** Relationship mapping.

---

# ❌ Missing but Needed (Publishing Gap Intelligence)

### **Missing Metric #1:**

**Songwriters found in MLC search but have no publisher listed**
→ *Partially captured but not explicitly grouped as a metric.*

### **Missing Metric #2:**

**Songwriters NOT found in MLC search at all**
→ *Not currently tracked.*

To solve these, you need the explicit enrichment flags:

```ts
// In shared/schema.ts - contacts table
mlcSearched: integer("mlc_searched").default(0),      // 0 = not searched, 1 = searched
mlcFoundInSearch: integer("mlc_found").default(0),     // 0 = not found, 1 = found
musicbrainzSearched: integer("mb_searched").default(0),
musicbrainzFound: integer("mb_found").default(0),
```

### These unlock four new metrics:

| Metric                                | Definition                     | Opportunity Type                |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| **MLC: Searched & Not Found**         | `mlcSearched=1 AND mlcFound=0` | 🔥 High-value unsigned targets  |
| **MLC: Never Searched**               | `mlcSearched=0`                | 📋 Enrichment backlog           |
| **MusicBrainz: Searched & Not Found** | Similar pattern                | 🟡 Secondary unsigned indicator |
| **MusicBrainz: Never Searched**       | Similar pattern                | 📋 Enrichment backlog           |

# 🔥 Recommended Next Steps (Opinionated)

### **1. Replace Deal-Ready with Score-Based + Enrichment Flags**

Current logic is flawed because emails never appear from enrichment.

**Recommended:**
`unsignedScore ≥ 7 AND mlcFoundInSearch = 0`

### **2. Add Missing MLC / MB Flags ASAP**

This will unlock the *actual* value of PubCo Live as a publishing intelligence engine.

### **3. Add New Metric: “Verified Self-Written Songs”**

Pairs with your scoring engine.

### **4. Add UI Filters:**

* “MLC Not Found”
* “Publisher Missing”
* “Writer Missing”
* “High Velocity Writers”
* “Self-Written + Emerging Artists”
