I'll review each of your points and provide recommendations without making any changes. Let me analyze the current state and suggest improvements:

Playlist Section Issues
1. Last Updated Not Showing for Multiple Playlists
Current Issue: The lastChecked field exists in the schema but may not be updating correctly during bulk operations.

Recommendation:

Ensure lastChecked is set during both individual and bulk playlist fetches
Add a PATCH /api/tracked-playlists/:id/touch endpoint to update timestamps
Consider showing "Never" vs formatted date more prominently
2. Table Structure Standardization
Current State: Comparing playlists-view.tsx vs dashboard.tsx (tracks):

Playlists: Uses custom grid layout with checkboxes in separate column
Tracks: Uses track-table.tsx with virtualization and different column structure
Recommendation:

Create a <PlaylistTable> component similar to <TrackTable>
Use same checkbox column pattern, sticky header, and virtualization
Standardize column widths and responsive behavior
Both should use <SortableTableHeader> from ui/sortable-table-header.tsx
3. Playlist Detail View Actions UI
Current State: Actions are in accordion sections with ghost buttons

Recommendation:

Move primary actions (View Tracks, Fetch Data) to top of drawer below hero image
Use gradient buttons for primary actions: variant="gradient"
Secondary actions (Refresh Metadata, Open Spotify) can use variant="outline"
Remove accordion for Actions section - keep actions always visible
Match the button layout from contact-detail-drawer.tsx (Quick Actions section)
4. Completeness Filter for Playlists
Current State: No completeness filtering exists for playlists

Recommendation:

Add similar filter pattern to tracks but with playlist-specific metrics:
Metadata Complete (has curator, followers, totalTracks)
Chartmetric Linked (has chartmetricUrl)
Recently Updated (lastChecked within 7 days)
Fetch Complete (isComplete = 1)
Has Tracks (totalTracks > 0)
Use same <Popover> + filter pills pattern from dashboard.tsx
Tracks Section Issues
1. Completeness Filter Review
Current Filters:

has-isrc, no-isrc
has-credits, no-credits
has-publisher, no-publisher
has-songwriter, no-songwriter
Recommendation - Add:

has-streams (spotifyStreams > 0)
high-score (unsignedScore >= 7)
enriched (creditsStatus = 'success')
failed-enrichment (creditsStatus = 'failed')
Recommendation - Remove:

None - all current filters are useful
2. "1706 Results" → "1706 Tracks"
Location: track-table.tsx line ~400

Current:

<div data-testid="text-results-count">
  Showing {tracks.length} {tracks.length === 1 ? "result" : "results"}
</div>
Proposed:

<div data-testid="text-results-count">
  Showing {tracks.length} {tracks.length === 1 ? "track" : "tracks"}
</div>
3. Remove Label from Track Header
Current: Takes up a full column in desktop view

Recommendation:

Remove <TableHead>Label</TableHead> from track-table.tsx
Remove corresponding <TableCell> for label column
This will give more space for songwriter/other columns
Label can still appear in detail drawer
4. Score Badge "High 8" → Shorter Format
Current: High 8 takes up too much space

Recommendation Options:

Option A: Just show number with color-coded badge: 8 (green), 5 (yellow), 2 (gray)
Option B: Icon + number: ⭐ 8 or 🎯 8
Option C: Number with small label: 8 with tooltip "High potential"
Best Choice: Option A - Most compact, color already indicates level

5. Remove "All Tags" Filter
Locations:

dashboard.tsx (main view)
details-drawer.tsx
Recommendation:

Remove the tag <Select> filter entirely from dashboard.tsx
Remove tag display from details-drawer.tsx track info section
Keep tag management in <TrackTagPopover> accessible via actions menu
This simplifies the UI since tags are primarily for organization, not discovery
Contacts Section Issues
1. Advanced Filter Not Working
Current: Button exists but doesn't show filter options

Recommendation:

The button at contacts.tsx line ~260 doesn't have proper <PopoverContent> implementation
Copy the completeness filter pattern from dashboard.tsx
Add contact-specific filters:
Has Email
Has Social Links (Instagram/Twitter)
Hot Leads Only
Chartmetric Linked
Score Range (slider 0-10)
2. Standardize Filter/Search Component
Current State: Contacts uses a nice <FilterBar> wrapper with search + quick filter pills

Recommendation - Standardize Across All Pages:

Standard Pattern:

<FilterBar>
  {/* Search Input */}
  <div className="flex-1 min-w-[200px]">
    <Search icon + Input />
  </div>
  
  {/* Dropdowns (page-specific) */}
  <Select /> {/* Week/Playlist/Stage */}
  
  {/* Advanced Filters Button */}
  <Popover>
    <Button>Filters + Badge</Button>
    <PopoverContent>...</PopoverContent>
  </Popover>
  
  {/* Quick Filter Pills (page-specific) */}
  <div className="flex gap-2">
    <Badge onClick={...} />
  </div>
  
  {/* Clear Filters */}
  {hasFilters && <Button variant="ghost">Clear</Button>}
</FilterBar>
Page-Specific Dropdowns:

Dashboard (Tracks): Week, Playlist, Tag
Playlists: Source, Genre (new)
Contacts: Stage, Owner (future)
Quick Filter Pills:

Dashboard: has-isrc, high-score, enriched
Contacts: Hot Leads, Chartmetric Linked, Positive WoW
Playlists: Editorial Only, Recently Updated, Complete
3. Contact Menu Actions Different from Other Tables
Current: Contacts uses <DropdownMenu> with different items than playlists/tracks

Recommendation - Standardize:
All tables should have:

Primary Action: View Details (opens drawer)
Communication: Send Email, Send DM
Management: Edit, Archive/Delete
External: Open in Spotify/Chartmetric (if applicable)
Pattern:

<DropdownMenuContent>
  <DropdownMenuItem>View Details</DropdownMenuItem>
  <DropdownMenuSeparator />
  <DropdownMenuItem>Send Email</DropdownMenuItem>
  <DropdownMenuItem>Send DM</DropdownMenuItem>
  <DropdownMenuSeparator />
  <DropdownMenuItem>External Link</DropdownMenuItem>
</DropdownMenuContent>
4. Contact Detail Drawer - Identifiers Section
Current: Takes up full card with 3 hash IDs

Recommendation:

Remove the Identifiers card entirely from main view
Move to a collapsible "Advanced" accordion at bottom of drawer (collapsed by default)
Most users don't need to see UUIDs during normal workflow
Saves significant vertical space for more important info (tracks, performance, notes)
5. Stacked Songwriter Name + Chartmetric ID Pattern
Current: Works well in contact detail drawer

Recommendation for Track Table:

{/* Track Name Column */}
<div className="flex-1 min-w-0">
  <div className="font-medium truncate">{track.trackName}</div>
  <div className="flex items-center gap-2 mt-1">
    {track.isrc ? (
      <Badge variant="outline" className="text-xs">
        <CheckCircle2 className="w-3 h-3 mr-1" />
        ISRC: {track.isrc}
      </Badge>
    ) : (
      <Badge variant="outline" className="text-xs text-muted-foreground">
        No ISRC
      </Badge>
    )}
  </div>
</div>
This pattern:

Stacks primary info (track name) with secondary metadata (ISRC confirmation)
Reduces horizontal column count
More scannable than separate columns
Similar to how contact cards show songwriter name + chartmetric ID
