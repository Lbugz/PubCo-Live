Here’s the **clean, final justification** you can use for the songwriter-focused scoring methodology — rewritten for clarity, aligned with your product, and fully consistent with the excerpt you selected.

No code changes. No updates. Just the *justification*.

---

# ✅ Why This Songwriter-Focused Methodology Makes Sense

The original scoring system was built for **artists**, not **songwriters**. But your platform’s goal is to **track every songwriter** (including those writing for major artists) and identify *who is unpublished or underrepresented*.

The updated scoring logic fixes the mismatch by measuring the things that actually matter for publishing A&R.

---

# 1️⃣ Core Problem the New Method Solves

Your database tracks **songwriters**, but the old scoring logic measured:

* Artist playlist placement (Fresh Finds)
* Artist label (major vs indie)
* Artist credibility signals

These do NOT reliably correlate to whether a **songwriter** has:

* a publisher
* representation
* available rights
* commercial momentum

So the methodology was misaligned with your publishing business.

---

# 2️⃣ The Songwriter-Correct Inputs (and Why They Matter)

## **1. Missing Publisher (+5)

→ #1 predictor of publishing opportunity**
If no publisher is listed:

* the songwriter is likely *unpublished*
* backend royalties may be unclaimed
* there’s no admin or deal blocking you

This is the most important signal in your entire system.

---

## **2. Missing Writer Metadata (+3)

→ Signals DIY artists and underrepresented writers**
Metadata gaps indicate:

* self-released artists writing their own songs
* incomplete PRO/admin registrations
* no management handling credits
* easier outreach and signing opportunity

This reliably identifies writers who are *not yet fully represented*.

---

## **3. Fresh Finds Only When Artist = Songwriter (+3)

→ Corrects the biggest false-positive in the old model**
Fresh Finds = editorial validation…
…but only for the **artist**, not every songwriter on the track.

So you only apply the Fresh Finds bonus when:

> the artist is also a songwriter on the track.

This turns Fresh Finds into a correct proxy for **emerging self-written songwriting talent**.

---

## **4. Indie Label Only Matters When Artist = Songwriter (+2)

→ Measures a real DIY songwriting opportunity**
Indie labels don’t tell you anything about hired songwriters.

But when the **artist wrote the song AND the release is indie**, you reliably identify:

* indie songwriters
* DIY creators
* highest-likelihood unpublished writers

This is where publishing deals are easiest to originate.

---

## **5. Stream Velocity (+2)

→ Commercial momentum = songwriting value rising**
Velocity indicates the composition itself is heating up.

This helps your team prioritize:

* fast-growing tracks
* trending writers
* songs gaining traction before competitors move

Velocity = urgency in publishing A&R.

---

## **6. Major Label Penalty ONLY When Artist = Songwriter (-2)

→ Fixes the biggest mistake in the old logic**
A songwriter may write for a major artist and still be:

* unpublished
* independent
* unsigned in both admin + PRO

So you only penalize the major-label scenario when:

> the artist is the songwriter *and* signed to a major.

Because in that specific case:

* majors often bundle publishing in 360/creative deals
* the songwriter is less likely available

This preserves legitimate opportunities among writers working with majors.

# 3️⃣ Why This Methodology Works Perfectly for Your Use Case

You said:

> “I'm building a database of **all songwriters**, including those who write for major artists.”

This model is aligned with that goal because it:

### ✔ Tracks **every songwriter**, not just DIY artists

No one gets filtered out because of the artist’s label.

### ✔ Prioritizes signals that matter *only* for publishing

Missing publisher ≫ missing label ≫ playlist placement.

### ✔ Corrects the false assumption that artist signals = songwriter signals

A songwriter’s career pathway is different than an artist’s.

### ✔ Adds velocity to catch emerging writers early

Before PROs or major publishers grab them.

### ✔ Gives bonus points to self-written + indie tracks

This is your high-yield acquisition zone.

### ✔ Keeps the scoring interpretable

You still have a clean 1–10 scale that’s quick for A&R to scan.

# 4️⃣ The Songwriter-Focused Rubric (Final)

```
const RUBRIC = {
  missingPublisher: 5,
  missingWriter: 3,
  artistIsWriter_FreshFinds: 3,
  artistIsWriter_Indie: 2,
  hasStreamVelocity: 2,
  majorLabelArtist_SameWriter: -2
};
```

---

# 5️⃣ In One Line:

**The methodology now measures *publishing opportunity*, not *artist momentum* — which makes it the correct model for a songwriter-first discovery engine.**

If you want, I can also produce:

* a 1-page internal A&R scoring explainer
* a scoring visualization for the UI
* a scoring audit sheet you can give your team
