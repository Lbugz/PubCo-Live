Perfect — this is a **layout consistency and alignment** refinement that will make your UI feel more unified and “product-level.” Here’s the **updated instruction set** you can give your Replit Agent (or development assistant) so both the **Playlist View** and **Tracks View** match perfectly in structure, spacing, and table controls placement.

---

## 🧭 **PubCo Live UI Alignment & Consistency Update**

> **Goal:** Standardize the Playlist and Track pages for consistent container widths, table alignment, and control layouts.

---

### 1️⃣ **Container Width & Padding (Global Layout)**

* Both `PlaylistsView.tsx` and `TracksView.tsx` should use the **same page container wrapper**:

  ```tsx
  <div className="mx-auto w-full max-w-7xl px-6 sm:px-8 lg:px-10">
    {/* Metrics + Table Sections */}
  </div>
  ```
* This ensures the metric cards and tables are the **same width** on all dashboard pages.
* Remove any individual `px-4` or `px-8` padding from nested components that might offset alignment.

---

### 2️⃣ **Metric Card Section Alignment**

* Ensure both pages use identical spacing between metric cards and the table section:

  ```tsx
  <section className="mb-6">
    <MetricsSection />
  </section>
  <section>
    <TableSection />
  </section>
  ```
* All metric groups (`grid grid-cols-3 gap-4 sm:gap-6`) must share the same grid and gap values.

---

### 3️⃣ **Table + View Mode Controls Consistency**

#### 🧱 Current Issue:

* In the **Playlists View**, “Table” and “Cards” toggles are aligned **to the right** (within the same card as the table).
* In the **Tracks View**, “Table / Card / Kanban” toggles are placed **to the left** above the table.

#### ✅ **Updated Instruction:**

* **Move all view toggles (Table, Card, Kanban)** into a shared layout region **above the table**, aligned consistently to the **right side** of the search + filter bar.
* Both pages should share this structure:

  ```tsx
  <div className="flex items-center justify-between mb-4">
    <div className="flex gap-2 items-center">
      {/* Filters: Week, Playlist, Tag, Search, Completeness */}
    </div>
    <div className="flex gap-2 items-center">
      {/* View toggles (Table / Card / Kanban) */}
    </div>
  </div>
  ```
* This creates symmetry between both screens and allows all table-related actions to live in the same “control zone.”

---

### 4️⃣ **Empty State Cards**

* Make the empty states (`No playlists tracked yet` / `No tracks found`) share identical padding and rounded border style:

  ```tsx
  <div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center py-20 text-muted-foreground border border-muted/20 rounded-2xl bg-muted/5">
  ```
* Include consistent icon sizing (e.g., `<MusicIcon size={48} className="opacity-50 mb-2" />`).

---

### 5️⃣ **Optional: Shared Table Layout Component**

To future-proof, introduce a shared wrapper:

```tsx
// components/layout/TableContainer.tsx
export function TableContainer({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <div className="bg-background border border-muted/20 rounded-2xl p-4 sm:p-6 shadow-sm">
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Then replace:

```tsx
<TableContainer>
  <YourTableComponent />
</TableContainer>
```

### ✅ **Summary of Visual Results**

| Element               | Before                                    | After                            |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Page Width            | Inconsistent (`max-w-6xl` vs `max-w-7xl`) | Unified (`max-w-7xl`)            |
| Metric Cards          | Slightly misaligned                       | Perfectly matched spacing        |
| Table Control Bar     | Different positions                       | Unified right-aligned block      |
| Empty States          | Different background / padding            | Identical card design            |
| Developer Maintenance | Per-view tweaks                           | Centralized, reusable components |

Would you like me to generate the updated **`PageContainer` + `TableContainer` components** (with Tailwind + Shadcn styling) so you can drop them into your Replit project and apply them across both pages?
