Chartmetric,,,,,,
The official Chartmetric API documentation.,,,,,,
Introduction,,,,,,
"The Chartmetric API is organized around REST. Our API provides predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
Check out our CHANGELOG to learn of the latest changes to the API and our API FAQ for answers to common questions and best practice recommendations for using our API.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Some helpful tips to keep in mind as you get started using the Chartmetric API:,,,,,,
,,,,,,
We include headers in each endpoint response to help you manage their rate limit.,,,,,,
"Access tokens are short-lived, but as long as they have not expired, you may continue to use the same access token — you do not need to request a new access token with every API request.",,,,,,
"Remember to URL encode your strings if you are calling our endpoints with names, titles, and anything that may have non-alphanumeric special characters.",,,,,,
"When calling an endpoint with a query parameter that accepts an array of values, use the format param[]=1&param[]=2&param[]=3.",,,,,,
Python Quick Start,,,,,,
Replace ... with your refresh token and ensure requests is installed with pip3 install requests before running.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
See Authorization - Get API access token for more details about how to authenticate with our API.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"from requests import get, post",,,,,,
from sys import exit,,,,,,
from pprint import pprint,,,,,,
HOST = 'https://api.chartmetric.com',,,,,,
TOKEN = '...',,,,,,
"res = post(f'{HOST}/api/token', json={""refreshtoken"": TOKEN})",,,,,,
if res.status_code != 200:,,,,,,
print(f'ERROR: received a {res.status_code} instead of 200 from /api/token'),,,,,,
exit(1),,,,,,
access_token = res.json()['token'],,,,,,
def Get(uri):,,,,,,
"return get(f'{HOST}{uri}', headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {access_token}'})",,,,,,
res = Get('/api/artist/206557'),,,,,,
if res.status_code != 200:,,,,,,
print(f'ERROR: received a {res.status_code} instead of 200 from /api/artist/:id'),,,,,,
exit(1),,,,,,
pprint(res.json()),,,,,,
Rate Limiting,,,,,,
"This section explains how our rate limiting model works, as this will help you understand the throughput you can expect to receive for your respective API subscription plan. Different API plans are subject to different levels of rate limiting. Chartmetric uses a sliding window rate limiting algorithm over a time period (in most cases this time period is 1 second aka 1000ms). Note that the sliding window approach is not based on fixed time periods.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"Perhaps the best way to illustrate how a sliding window works vs a fixed time period is with an example. Let's say you have an API plan that allows 2 requests/second (req/sec), and we have some requests being made as shown by the following diagram:",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"In this example above, we see two fixed time periods of one second each.",,,,,,
"For the first fixed time period of 1 second, we see 2 requests.",,,,,,
"For the second fixed time period of 1 second, we see 1 request.",,,,,,
"However, a sliding window approach starts from when the first request is received. From the above, we see there are actually 3 requests happening within a one second period, from when the sliding window starts. Based on your rate limit of 2 req/sec, this third request would exceed your allowed rate limit.",,,,,,
"To help you manage your rate of requests and stay within your plan's rate limit, we provide useful metadata in our response headers. After any request is made, the current rate limit data can be found in the headers of the response as follows:",,,,,,
,,,,,,
Header Name,Description,,,,,
X-RateLimit-Limit,"Number of requests allowed per your rate-limit time period (usually one second). This number only changes when your API subscription plan changes, and is a constant in practice.",,,,,
X-RateLimit-Remaining,"Number of requests remaining in current time period: X-RateLimit-Limit - (count of requests received by server in last time period). Note that this field is determined at the precise time each request is received, and does not treat time periods as discrete fixed periods.",,,,,
X-RateLimit-Reset,A Unix epoch time representing the earliest time at which a new request would succeed: (timestamp of oldest request received by server in last time period) + (duration of your time period).,,,,,
Throughput,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"All of our API plans are metered on a req/sec basis, which tracks the number of requests received by our API over a given time period. It's important to distinguish that this is not the same as the number of requests completed over a given time period, as different endpoints have varying levels of computational complexity and may take longer to query (we consider a request as being completed once the API response has been sent).",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"To better illustrate how this may affect throughput, let's say you make 100 endpoint requests serially with a rate limit of 25 req/sec, and every request is able to complete and send a response within 1 second. You will effectively be able to receive API responses for all 100 requests.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"Now let's say you make an additional 100 endpoint requests still serially, and still at a rate limit of 25 req/sec, and this time 80 requests are able to complete and send a response within 1 second, but 20 requests are computationally-heavy and take 2 seconds to return. Your throughput in this case will be approximately 20 req/sec.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"Note that requests sent in parallel may enable you to make requests (and receive responses) faster, although you will likely hit your rate limit faster as well. Additionally, sending requests at a constant rate will help to maximize your throughput.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
Error Responses,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"Chartmetric uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general: Codes in the 2xx range indicate success. Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, a charge failed, etc.). Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with Chartmetric's servers (which are rare).",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"Some 4xx errors that can be handled programmatically (e.g., wrong parameter) include an error code that briefly explains the error reported.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
Undocumented Fields,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"Some of our endpoints may return metadata in the response that are not itemized in this documentation. We consider these as unofficial properties, and they may be removed or modified in the future.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"You are free to use the information in these properties, but we recommend you add appropriate error checking so your application does not break if these properties are removed or modified.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
We do not consider changes to or removal of unofficial properties as breaking changes.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Authentication,,,,,,
,,,,,,
The Chartmetric API uses tokens to authenticate requests. We require two types of tokens to verify security credentials and process requests:,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Refresh Token,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"The refresh token is the first step of authentication, which is used to initialize a login session and request for an access token. For each API user that signs up with Chartmetric, a refresh token is assigned and sent via e-mail to your personal e-mail account. To sign up as an API user, please email [hi@chartmetric.com](mailto:hi@chartmetric.com?subject=Chartmetric API Inquiry).",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"Your API tokens carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure. Do not share your secret API tokens in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, etc. If you are experiencing issues with the refresh token, please contact [hi@chartmetric.com.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
Access Token,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"The access token contains security credentials for a login session and identifies the user, and is required for all resource requests. Every access token expires in one hour. After expiration, users need to request for another access token using the refresh token.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
Implementation,,,,,,
Authorization,,,,,,
Authorization - Get API access token,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Get API access token used to make all other API requests.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"If you are experiencing issues with the refresh token, please contact hi@chartmetric.com.",,,,,,

"""description"": ""Born and raised in New York City, twin sisters Nicole and Natalie Albino also known as Nina Sky, entered the Billboard Charts in 2004 with their hit song &#34;Move Ya Body.&#34; It was an impactful debut landing at number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100. That same year, the sistersʼ infectious chorus on NORE&#39;s reggaeton anthem “Oye Mi Canto,” propelled the song to crossover success. Since their debut, they&#39;ve established their names not only as singers and songwriters but well-respected DJʼs providing the soundscape for festivals and events worldwide.\nNina Sky collaborators include Diplo, Major Lazer, Sean Paul, Salaam Remi, Pitbull, and The Alchemist among others. As DJʼs, they&#39;ve curated sets for The Museum of Modern Art (MOMA), the GLAAD Awards, Dolce &amp; Gabanna, MAC, and more. Their DJ sets are energetic and high spirited meshing multiple genres with a genuine connection to the audience. \nWhile 2024 marks 20 years since Nicole and Natalie released their debut, the authenticity they embody as artists has continued to create a boundless stream of opportunity. With experience, self-awareness, and an array of musical projects under their belt, the twins continue to connect with their fans on a massive level."",",,,,,,

Artist - Social Audience Stats,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"Get Social Audience Analysis and Stats for an artist. Note: We check for new reports daily and update the corresponding audience data only when a new report is present in its API. Most audience reports are updated on a weekly basis, so we should have at least one update per month for this data. However, when using the date parameter, some dates will return empty response structures. An empty response means that the data didn't receive an update for that date. Additionally, while the web app displays audience numbers updated hourly, this endpoint uses cached historical data updated daily to support higher request volumes. This difference in update frequency may lead to small discrepancies in the data.",,,,,,

Sorting,,,,,,
"Sorting is done by passing any valid combination of <period>.<stat> from the table above to the parameter sortColumn. For example, given the stat airplay_streams, it's possible to sort by any of latest.airplay_streams, weekly_diff.airplay_streams, and monthly_diff.airplay_streams.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"Since score and release_date are not associated with any period, they are passed just as sortColumn=score and sortColumn=release_date.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
Applying range filters,,,,,,
"It's possible to apply range filters to all of the stats that were presented above. First, the range_period parameter is used to set the stat period. For example, setting range_period=weekly_diff, will filter the specified stats by their weekly changes. The stats that are not associated with any period ignore the value of range_period.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"For each stat, there is a corresponding min_ and max_ parameter to set the lower and upper boundaries used to filter, respectively. For example, we have both min_tiktok_posts and max_tiktok_posts parameters that are used to set the tiktok_posts lower and upper boundaries of the given period. As a second example, setting range_period=latest and max_tiktok_posts=100 will filter tracks that currently (using the latest available stats) have less than 100 TikTok posts.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
To summarize:,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Set the period to apply the range filter. E.g.: range_period=weekly_diff to apply filters considering 7-day changes in track stats.,,,,,,
"Set the min_<stat> and max_<stat> parameters to be applied to the filter. E.g.: min_spotify_popularity=1 and max_spotify_popularity=10 to filter the tracks that have changed between [1, 10] places in their Spotify popularity in the last week.",,,,,,
"It's possible to set min_score, max_score, min_release_date, and max_release_date regardless of the range_period value.",,,,,,
"Note that it's possible to set negative values to these filters. E.g.: min_spotify_popularity=-2 to filter tracks that have a spotify_popularity of more than -2 for the given range_period. It's possible to set as many range filters as desired, but note that if too many filters are applied it's likely no tracks will match.",,,,,,

The original functionality to provide a full list of cities will be deprecated and this API will soon be revamped to provide the top 5 cities for an artist instead.
