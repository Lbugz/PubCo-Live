I'll audit all notifications across your application and provide a comprehensive breakdown. Let me analyze the codebase to identify all notification patterns.

Based on my analysis, here's a comprehensive audit of all notifications in your application:

Analysis & Optimization Recommendations
Current Notification Patterns:
Toast (Immediate Actions) - Used for instant feedback on user actions

Component: client/src/components/ui/toaster.tsx
Hook: client/src/hooks/use-toast.ts
Variants: success, info, warning, destructive
Auto-dismisses after 5 seconds
System Notifications (Persistent) - Used for background jobs and important events

Component: client/src/components/NotificationCenter.tsx
Backend: server/services/notificationService.ts
Stored in database, user can dismiss
Shows unread count badge
WebSocket Live Updates - Used for real-time job progress

Shows active jobs with progress bars
Updates every second during enrichment
Transitions to system notification on completion
Issues Found:
No toast notifications are actually shown in the current codebase - only the infrastructure exists
Duplicate notification systems - WebSocket active jobs AND system notifications for the same events
Missing validation feedback - Forms don't show field-level validation toasts
Inconsistent error handling - Some API errors show toasts (if implemented), others fail silently
No loading states with notifications for long operations
Recommendations:
Would you like me to propose:

Standardize toast implementation across all pages
Add missing notification triggers for user actions
Consolidate WebSocket notifications to reduce duplication
Add loading toasts for async operations
Create a notification style guide for consistent UX
