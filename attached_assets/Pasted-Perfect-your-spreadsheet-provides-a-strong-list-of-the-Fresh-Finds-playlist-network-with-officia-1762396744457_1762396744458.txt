## 🧠 **How to Use This**

1. Save this file in your Replit project under `/config/playlists.json`.
2. The `fetchPlaylists.ts` script will iterate over each playlist and retrieve its tracks weekly.
3. Later, you can expand this file to include “Top 50” or regional playlists for discovery scaling.

---

Would you like me to:

* Add **Top 50 / Viral / New Music Friday** playlists too,
  or
* Keep this focused purely on the *Fresh Finds network* for now (ideal for independent discovery + publishing focus)?
