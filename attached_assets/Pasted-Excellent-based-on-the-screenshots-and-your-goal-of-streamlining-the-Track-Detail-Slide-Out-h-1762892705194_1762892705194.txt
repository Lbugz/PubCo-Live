Excellent — based on the screenshots and your goal of streamlining the **Track Detail Slide-Out**, here’s a proposed redesign that balances hierarchy, space, and clarity while keeping songwriters at the core.

---

## 🎧 **Proposed Layout: Track Detail Drawer (v2)**

### **1. Header Zone (Top Section)**

**Left Side (Image / Placeholder Icon)**

* Keep the album art or track icon smaller (optional, not dominant).
* Use the space to the **right of it** for key metadata.

**Right Side (Track Metadata)**

```
───────────────────────────────
Killher                         [Score 8 ⭑]
Year Of The Rat Records          Label
Fresh Finds Heavy                Playlist
Added: 3 days ago                Added
───────────────────────────────
```

* You can place the **Score 8** badge as a small pill or ring near the title (not huge and centered as before).
* Consider using subtle color rings (green for 8–10, yellow for 5–7, red for <5).

---

### **2. Actions Row (Compact & Dynamic)**

A **dropdown / icon bar** with quick access:

```
⚙️ Actions ▾  [Enrich Data | Contact | Tag | Open in Spotify]
```

* Keep it condensed in one line or under a single icon-trigger button.
* When clicked, it expands into contextual options.
* Alternatively, float a small ⚙️ icon at top right of the drawer for global actions.

---

### **3. Main Body (Songwriters Focused Section)**

#### **Songwriters Pane**

This becomes the main content area:

```
🎼 Songwriters
───────────────────────────────
[<] Chris Lalic (Verified)
No social links yet  
Publisher: —  
Email: contact@example.com  
Instagram: @chrislalic  
Twitter/X: —  
TikTok: —  

🗂️ Tags: [Sync] [Potential Deal]  
📝 Notes: “Reached out on IG; awaiting reply.”

───────────────
[>] Qarin Hipe (Unverified)
No publisher found
```

* Use **left/right arrows or swipe** to navigate between songwriters.
* Alternatively, a **dropdown or tabs** labeled “Chris Lalic | Qarin Hipe” for switching.
* Include **Tag + Contact + Publisher Info + Socials + Notes** inline (no modal needed unless editing).

---

### **4. Activity History (Bottom Section)**

Keep it minimal and scrollable:

```
📜 Activity
───────────────────────────────
✔️ Track enriched via spotify-credits     <1 min ago  
⚠️ No MusicBrainz record for Qarin Hipe   <1 min ago  
ℹ️ Found record for Chris Lalic (no socials)  <1 min ago
```

* Small icons and timestamps keep it compact.
* Consider grouping by event type (Discovery, Enrichment, Outreach).

---

### **5. Optional Enhancements**

**A. Dual-Column Layout for Larger Screens**
If screen width allows:

* **Left column:** Track Info & Actions
* **Right column:** Songwriter Carousel + Activity Log

**B. Add “Contact State” Indicators**

* 🟢 Contacted | 🟡 Pending | 🔴 Not Contacted
* Useful for CRM purposes without opening modal.

**C. Tagging Shortcut**
Hover over songwriter → small “🏷️” icon appears to add tag quickly.

---

## 💡 Opinionated Design Principle

Your drawer should evolve from a *track view* to a *relationship hub*.
Instead of treating this as static metadata, it becomes the **bridge between discovery and dealmaking** — a space to take action on songwriters directly.

So:

* Keep **Track Info** concise and up top (context).
* Center the **Songwriter Profiles** as the actionable middle.
* End with **Activity Logs** (receipts of what’s been done).

Would you like me to mock this up visually (in Figma-style layout or ShadCN React JSX)?
I can generate either:

1. A **visual wireframe** for UX review, or
2. A **code-ready JSX/Tailwind layout** for your Replit front-end.
