# **AI Pub Feed — Discovery Platform Overview**

## **Internal A&R Team Guide**

---

## **What It Does**

AI Pub Feed automatically discovers unsigned artists and unpublished songwriters from Spotify playlists, enriches their metadata, scores their commercial potential, and manages outreach through a built-in CRM system.

# **1️⃣ Playlist Tracking**

### **Purpose**

Ingest Spotify playlists (Fresh Finds, editorial, or custom) to detect emerging talent and build weekly snapshots of new tracks.

### **How It Works**

- Supports both public and editorial playlists (scraping fallback for restricted ones)
- Automatically pulls all track metadata (artist, album, release date)
- Tracks 150+ songs weekly across multiple Fresh Finds playlists
- Optional weekly auto-refresh (`ENABLE_AUTO_SCRAPE`)

### **During Fetch**

### **Playlist Metadata Retrieval**

- Attempts Chartmetric API first (analytics, cross‑platform identifiers)
- Falls back to Spotify API for public playlists
- Uses Puppeteer scraping for editorial playlists (RapCaviar, Fresh Finds)
- Captures playlist name, curator, follower count, and track total

### **Track Metadata Collection**

- Pulls title, artist names, album data, Spotify URL
- Saves album artwork thumbnails for UI
- Stores playlist context for each track
- Creates snapshot timestamps for historical comparisons

### **Automatic Enrichment Trigger**

- New tracks enter the enrichment queue instantly
- Background worker processes up to 50 tracks at a time
- Real-time progress visible in the **Activity** tab
- Enrichment layers add ISRCs, credits, stream counts, and more

### **Duplicate Prevention**

- Detects existing tracks via Spotify Track ID
- Cross-references tracks that appear across multiple playlists
- Prevents redundant enrichment jobs

### **Key User Actions**

- Open **Playlists** page
- Click **Add Playlist**, paste a Spotify URL
- Fetch completes in 2–10 seconds
- Enrichment begins immediately in the background

# **2️⃣ Multi‑Phase Enrichment Pipeline**

### **Purpose**

Convert raw playlist tracks into complete, rights‑relevant metadata for scouting and publishing decisions.

---

## **Phase 1 — Chartmetric + Spotify API (Batch)**

### **What Happens**

- **Chartmetric Integration:**
    - Cross‑platform analytics
    - ISRC lookup and matching
    - Chartmetric ID stored for ongoing performance tracking
- **Spotify API:**
    - Recovers ISRCs
    - Pulls labels, release dates, popularity, audio features
    - Retrieves artist genres and follower counts

### **Outcome**

✔️ Nearly 100% ISRC recovery rate for valid tracks

---

## **Phase 2 — Web Scraping (Puppeteer)**

### **What Happens**

- Extracts songwriter/producer credits from Spotify track pages
- Scrapes real‑time stream counts
- Captures metadata missing from API responses

### **Outcome**

✔️ Reveals unsigned writers and missing publishing metadata

---

## **Phase 3 — MusicBrainz Lookup**

### **What Happens**

- Queries MusicBrainz by ISRC and track metadata
- Retrieves songwriter/publisher details
- Adds global creator identifiers

### **Outcome**

✔️ Provides deeper publishing context for rights evaluation

---

## **Phase 4 — MLC Publisher Search (In Development)**

### **What Happens**

- Queries The MLC API for authoritative publishing data
- Identifies publisher relationships tied to ISRCs
- Confirms unsigned/unpublished status via U.S. mechanical rights

### **Status**

Authentication working; search endpoints returning 401 (support ticket active).

---

### **Enrichment Actions**

- Runs automatically after playlist ingestion
- Monitor via **Activity** page (real‑time WebSocket)
- Re-enrich any track via actions menu
- Phase 1 completes in ~30 seconds per 50 tracks
- Phase 2 takes ~2–3 minutes per track due to scraping

---

# **3️⃣ Proprietary Scoring Algorithm**

### **Purpose**

Assign a 1–10 score indicating unsigned/unpublished likelihood and commercial potential.

### **Scoring Inputs**

- **Fresh Finds Appearance (+3)** — editorial validation
- **Independent Label (+2)** — proxy indicator for unsigned status
- **Missing Writer/Publisher Data (+2)** — gap signals opportunity
- **Stream Velocity (variable)** — growth acceleration triggers urgency

### **User Actions**

- View scores in **Tracks** page
- Filter to high‑quality leads (score ≥7)
- Export CSV lists for deeper research

---

# **4️⃣ Contacts CRM & Funnel Management**

### **Purpose**

Track writer discovery, growth, and outreach in a structured publishing pipeline.

### **Stages**

- **Discovery Pool** — <100K streams (775 contacts)
- **Watch List** — 100K–1M streams or >20% WoW growth (1 contact)
- **Active Search** — >1M streams or >50% WoW growth (0 contacts)

### **CRM Features**

- **Global Dashboard:** total contacts, hot leads, funnel breakdown
- **Filterable Table:** search by name, stage, or growth
- **Contact Drawer:**
    - Stats: total streams, track count, WoW %
    - Quick actions: set hot lead, move stage, start outreach
    - Tabs: Tracks, Performance, Activity, Notes
- **Performance Tracking:**
    - Weekly snapshots of stream counts
    - Automatic WoW calculations
    - Auto‑promotion based on velocity

### **Final Note**

This system provides an end‑to‑end pipeline for playlist‑driven A&R sourcing, metadata enrichment, publishing intelligence, and relationship management. It is designed to surface opportunities early and provide clear, data‑driven workflows for scouting and outreach.
