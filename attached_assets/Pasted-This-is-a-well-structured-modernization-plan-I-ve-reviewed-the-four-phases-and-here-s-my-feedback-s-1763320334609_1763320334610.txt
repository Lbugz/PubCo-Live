This is a well-structured modernization plan! I've reviewed the four phases and here's my feedback specific to your AI Pub Feed platform:

✅ Strong Foundations
Phase 1 (Quick Wins) is spot-on:

Removing the "Label" column from tracks table makes sense—it's better suited for the detail drawer
Simplifying score badges to just colored numbers (8, 5, 2) will improve scannability
The advanced filter popover for contacts is definitely needed—those filters (Has Email, Hot Leads, Score Range) are highly relevant for A&R workflows
Phase 2 (Standardization) addresses real pain points:

Your current tables (tracks, contacts, playlists) do have inconsistent patterns—a unified base component will help
The universal FilterBar concept is smart given that all three sections need similar filter UX
🤔 Considerations & Questions
Tag Removal from Dashboard/Drawer

You're proposing to remove "All Tags" filter and tag display, keeping tagging only via the action menu
Question: Do you use tags frequently enough that they should remain visible, or are they rarely used? If tags are core to your workflow, hiding them might hurt discoverability.
Action Button Integration (Phase 3)

The plan suggests three options for integrating primary actions into the filter bar
Recommendation: For A&R workflows, I'd lean toward the right-aligned action zone rather than a consolidated "Actions" menu—you want "Add Playlist" and "Fetch Data" to be immediately visible, not hidden behind a click.
Stacked Information Pattern (Phase 4)

Great for reducing horizontal space, but consideration: Track names can be long—stacking with ISRC badges might create very tall rows. May want to test with real data first.
Missing from Plan:

No mention of the Activity Panel or WebSocket updates—will those remain unchanged?
The Publishing Intelligence metrics section we just built—should that get any UI treatment in this refresh?
🚀 Recommended Adjustments
Add to Phase 1: Fix the toast stacking issue that was mentioned in your progress notes (duplicate WebSocket notifications)

Prioritize for Phase 2: The contacts advanced filter popover should maybe move to Phase 2 since it's part of the larger FilterBar standardization work

Phase 3 Sequence: I'd tackle playlist completeness filters before track filters—playlists are the entry point, so improving that discoverability has higher ROI
