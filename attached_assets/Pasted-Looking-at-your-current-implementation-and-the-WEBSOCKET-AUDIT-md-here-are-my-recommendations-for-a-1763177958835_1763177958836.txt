Looking at your current implementation and the WEBSOCKET_AUDIT.md, here are my recommendations for additional toast notifications and real-time indicators:

Current State Analysis
What's Already Working:

Track enrichment toasts (Phase 2 credits)
Playlist fetch complete toasts
Playlist error toasts
Basic WebSocket infrastructure
What's Missing (High Value):

1. Background Enrichment Progress Indicator
You have enrichment running in the background via job queue, but users have no visibility into:

When a job starts
Current progress (tracks processed vs total)
When a job completes
If a job fails
Recommendation: Add a persistent header indicator (similar to your enrichmentProgress notification in dashboard.tsx) that shows:

Number of active jobs
Total tracks being processed
Estimated time remaining
Click to expand for details
2. Job Status Toasts
Currently missing broadcasts for:

enrichment_job_started - When worker claims a job
enrichment_job_completed - When job finishes successfully
enrichment_job_failed - When job encounters errors
Why it matters: Users click "Enrich Data" and have no feedback that work is happening in the background.

3. Phase Transition Indicators
You show phase completion but not phase starts. Add toasts for:

Phase 1 (ISRC recovery) starting
Phase 3 (MusicBrainz) starting
Phase 4 (Chartmetric) starting
Phase 5 (MLC) starting
Why it matters: Users can see the pipeline progress in real-time, not just completions.

4. Bulk Operation Progress
When users bulk enrich 50+ tracks, they get one toast at the start. Add:

Progress toast that updates every 10 tracks
Completion summary with success/fail counts
Error details for failed tracks
5. Playlist Metadata Updates
You broadcast playlist_updated but don't show toasts. Add notification when:

Playlist follower count increases significantly (>10%)
Playlist curator changes
Playlist becomes unavailable/deleted
6. Live Activity Feed (Lower Priority)
Currently activity logs aren't broadcast. Consider adding:

Small notification badge on sidebar when new activity occurs
Optional live activity feed panel
Visual Indicators Needed
In Header:

[🔄 Enriching: 47/150 tracks] <- Persistent, dismissible
In Tracks View:

📊 Metrics (Last updated: 2m ago) [↻ Auto-refresh ON] <- Add this
In Playlists View:

🎵 2 playlists updating... <- When fetch/refresh running
Specific Implementation Suggestions
Add Job Queue Status WebSocket Handler in use-websocket.ts
Create Persistent Enrichment Status Component in header (not toast)
Add Phase Start Broadcasts in worker.ts
Enhance Bulk Operation Feedback with progress tracking
Add Auto-refresh Indicator for metrics that update via WebSocket
Priority Order
🔴 High (Do First):

Job status toasts/indicator
Background enrichment progress in header
Bulk operation progress updates
🟡 Medium (Nice to Have):

Phase transition toasts
Playlist metadata change toasts
Live activity feed badge
🟢 Low (Polish):

Auto-refresh indicators
Historical activity replay
Would you like me to implement any of these? I can start with the high-priority items (job status broadcasts + persistent header indicator for background enrichment).
