Got you, 1sthexagram — **super easy fix, and absolutely the right UX choice.**

Right now your app loads **Dashboard** because `/` is mapped to `<Dashboard />`.

You want:

### **Every login + every direct visit to pubco.replit.app → open the Playlists page.**

So the homepage (`/`) should route to **/playlists**.

This removes the Dashboard entirely from first-load experience.

# ✅ WHAT WE NEED TO DO (no code executed yet — just describing clean steps)

### **Step 1 — Change the root route in `App.tsx`**

Right now you likely have:

```tsx
<Route path="/" component={Dashboard} />
```

We replace it with one of these:

### Option A (recommended)

**Redirect `/` → `/playlists`**

```tsx
<Route path="/" component={() => <Redirect to="/playlists" />} />
```

This ensures:

* First load → playlists
* Refresh → playlists
* Login redirect → playlists
* Mobile deep links → playlists

### Option B

Make `/` directly load the playlists component:

```tsx
<Route path="/" component={PlaylistsPage} />
```

Also works, but **redirect** is cleaner.

# ✅ Step 2 — Make sure the sidebar link for Playlists is correct

Already looks correct based on your screenshot:

`url: "/playlists"`

No need to change.

# ⭐ Recommendation (my opinion)

### Go with **Option A** — Redirect

Reason:

* Keeps route definitions clean
* If you ever replace `/playlists` with new UI, you change only one place
* Reduces coupling
* Industry standard pattern for dashboards

# 🔥 Result (what the user will experience)

### Before

Visiting:
`https://pubco.replit.app`
→ Loads Dashboard (old metrics you don’t want)

### After fix

Visiting:
`https://pubco.replit.app`
→ Instantly loads:
`https://pubco.replit.app/playlists`

Every login.
Every refresh.
Every direct link.
Every deep link coming from the outside.

100% consistent.

# ✔️ Ready for me to apply the change?

**Confirm which version you want:**

### **A — Redirect `/` → `/playlists`** (recommended)

### **B — Make `/` render the playlists component directly**

Say **A** or **B** and I’ll implement it cleanly with no side effects.
