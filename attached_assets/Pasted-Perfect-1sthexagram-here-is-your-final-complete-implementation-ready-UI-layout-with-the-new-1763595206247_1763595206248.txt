Perfect, 1sthexagram — here is your **final, complete, implementation-ready UI layout** with the new **Scoring tab** integrated into the Contact Drawer.

This is written precisely for your Replit agent and development environment.
It includes structure, ordering, component responsibilities, and what to remove from other sections.

# 🔥 **FINAL CONTACT DRAWER UI LAYOUT (WITH SCORING TAB)**

### *Implementation-Ready Instructions for Replit Agent*

---

# **1. Overall Drawer Structure (Top to Bottom)**

```
[Contact Header]
[Contact Information Section]
[Social Media Section]
[Tab Bar]
    Tracks | Scoring | Activity | Notes | Performance
[Active Tab Content]
```

---

# **2. CONTACT HEADER (unchanged except for removing scoring block)**

**Keep:**

* Contact name
* Contact button
* Mark Hot Lead button
* List dropdown (Discovery Pool / Watch List / etc.)
* Score badge (e.g., “8/10”)
* Close X

**Remove from header:**

* Any score breakdown
* Any scoring explanation
* Any summary line
* Confidence level

**Optional Addition Under Name:**

```
Songwriter • 2 tracks found • Data completeness: 56%
Discovered via: Fresh Finds Indie
```

---

# **3. CONTACT INFORMATION SECTION**

**Keep same structure**, but add optional improvements:

**A. Add enrichment info:**

```
Last enriched: <timestamp>
Data completeness: <percentage>
```

**B. Optional collapse for empty fields** (if agent wants to implement):

```
Publishing Metadata (collapsed)
Contact Info (collapsed)
```

**Do NOT place scoring info here anymore.**

---

# **4. SOCIAL MEDIA SECTION**

Same as current.

If blank:

```
No links found • Add Link
```

---

# **5. TAB BAR (UPDATED)**

### **Final Order (must implement):**

1. **Tracks**
2. **Scoring** ← ⭐ NEW TAB
3. Activity
4. Notes
5. Performance

**Reasoning:**
Tracks → Scoring → Activity follow the natural A&R workflow.

---

# **6. SCORING TAB — NEW COMPONENT (FULL SPEC)**

This is the content shown when user clicks **Scoring** in the tab bar.

---

## **SCORING TAB LAYOUT**

```
[Unsigned Score]
10/10 — Medium Confidence

[1-line summary]
“Strong unsigned signals. Fresh Finds placement and missing publishing metadata.”

--- Discovery ---
Fresh Finds playlist                +3

--- Publishing ---
No publisher metadata               +3

--- Metadata Completeness ---
Data 56% complete (partial)         +2

[Total Score]
Total: 3 + 3 + 2 = 10/10

Last updated: 11/19/2025
```

---

## **SCORING TAB — IMPLEMENTATION RULES FOR AGENT**

**1. No weighting.**
All point values must be integers based on the simplified scoring.

**2. Group signals under these exact sections:**

* Discovery
* Publishing
* Metadata Completeness

**3. Generate a 1-line summary:**
Examples:

* If Fresh Finds + No publisher:
  “Strong unsigned signals. Fresh Finds placement and missing publishing metadata.”
* If only metadata incomplete:
  “Limited metadata available. Status unclear but leans unsigned.”

**4. Add a Total Score line:**

```
Total: <sum_of_points> = <final_score>/10
```

**5. Add timestamp from backend scoring:**

```
Last updated: <timestamp>
```

**6. Remove decimals from any score**
(e.g., +3.15 → +3)

**7. Do not duplicate signals per track.**
Each signal appears **once**, representing the combined effect.

---

# **7. OTHER TABS (NO SCORING INFO ANYMORE)**

### **Tracks Tab**

Cards only show:

* Track name
* Artists
* Label/Distribution
* Playlist badges
* Stream count
* Release year

**No scoring lines.**

---

### **Activity Tab**

Shows enrichment jobs, list moves, scoring recalculations, etc.

---

### **Notes Tab**

No changes.

---

### **Performance Tab**

Keep as is; usually empty early on.

---

# 🚀 **FULL REPLIT AGENT INSTRUCTION BLOCK (COPY/PASTE)**

Use the following with the Replit Agent:

---

### **REPLIT AGENT INSTRUCTIONS — CONTACT DRAWER SCORE TAB UPDATE**

**1. Add a new tab to the Contact Drawer called “Scoring.”**
Tab order must be:

```
Tracks | Scoring | Activity | Notes | Performance
```

**2. Move ALL scoring breakdown content from the main drawer into the new “Scoring” tab.**
Remove scoring sections from all other parts of the UI.

**3. In the Scoring tab, display:**

* `<score>/10 — <confidence>`
* 1-line summary sentence
* Grouped scoring categories:

  * Discovery
  * Publishing
  * Metadata Completeness
* Each signal with integer points only
* Total score line
* Last updated timestamp

**4. Use exactly this structure inside the Scoring tab:**

```
[Unsigned Score]
10/10 — Medium Confidence

[Summary Sentence]

--- Discovery ---
Fresh Finds playlist                +3

--- Publishing ---
No publisher metadata               +3

--- Metadata Completeness ---
Data 56% complete (partial)         +2

Total: 3 + 3 + 2 = 10/10

Last updated: <timestamp>
```

**5. Remove all weighting, multipliers, and decimal scores from UI.**

**6. Do not duplicate signals even if multiple tracks contribute.**

**7. Keep the score badge (e.g., “10/10”) in the Contact header, but nothing else from scoring.**

# If you want next:

👉 I can generate the **React/TSX components** (`ContactScoringTab.tsx` + tab integration)
👉 Or a **Figma-style wireframe** for your design team
👉 Or a **backend response format update** for scoring

Just tell me which format you want.
