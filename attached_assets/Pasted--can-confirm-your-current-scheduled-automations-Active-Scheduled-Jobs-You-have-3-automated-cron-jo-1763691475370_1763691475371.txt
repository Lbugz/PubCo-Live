 can confirm your current scheduled automations:

Active Scheduled Jobs
You have 3 automated cron jobs configured in server/scheduler.ts:

1. Fresh Finds Weekly Update
Schedule: Every Friday at 9:00 AM (0 9 * * 5)
Purpose: Automatically scrapes the Fresh Finds playlist and stores new tracks to the database
Process: Uses Spotify playlist scraping (either via microservice or direct Puppeteer) to capture weekly Fresh Finds additions
2. Failed Enrichment Retry
Schedule: Daily at 2:00 AM (0 2 * * *)
Purpose: Retries enrichment for tracks that previously failed or returned no data
Process: Finds tracks with failed enrichment attempts older than 7 days, queues up to 100 tracks for retry enrichment
3. Weekly Performance Snapshots
Schedule: Every Monday at 1:00 AM (0 1 * * 1)
Purpose: Captures weekly performance metrics for calculating week-over-week growth
Process: Creates performance snapshots to enable WoW growth tracking for contacts
Activation Status
All jobs are controlled by the ENABLE_AUTO_SCRAPE environment variable:

If set to true → Jobs run on schedule
If not set or false → Jobs are registered but don't execute
Now, regarding the weighted scoring system upgrade - I understand you want to keep the signal-by-signal breakdown visible in the UI while implementing the new category-based scoring. This makes total sense for transparency.

I'll implement a hybrid approach:

Backend: 6 weighted categories (Publishing Status, Release Pathway, Early Career Signals, etc.)
UI: Show category scores prominently, but make them expandable to reveal the underlying signals that contributed to each category
Let me build this out:


Opened server/scoring/contactScoring.ts

Executed rg -n 'export.*ContactScoreResult|export.*TrackScore|export.*TrackSignal' server/scoring/contactScoring.ts

Implemented weighted category scoring system
Checked console and system logs
Perfect! The backend scoring system has been successfully updated with the new category-based model. Now I need to update the frontend UI to display the category cards with expandable signal details, and then create a migration script.


Update scoring to use weighted categories
Optimized Agent memory

Executed rg -n 'Scoring.*Tab|Score.*Section|Signal.*Display' client/src/components/contact-detail-drawer.tsx

Opened client/src/components/contact-detail-drawer.tsx
Now I'll update the Scoring tab to display the new category-based scoring with expandable sections:


Opened client/src/components/contact-detail-drawer.tsx

Updated scoring tab UI

Checked code issues

Restarted Start application
Perfect! Now let me add the missing imports for the Collapsible component and Progress component:

Task left:

Redesign score tab with category cards
Update contacts with new scoring system
Check score calculations on sample contacts
