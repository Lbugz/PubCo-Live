Got you, 1sthexagram — **yes**, if almost every track in your system is from *late 2025*, then recency weighting and stream-based weighting will **distort scores**, create noise, and give false precision.

**Removing weighting is the right move for Phase 1.**

Here is the **clean, weight-free scoring system** — simple, fair, and consistent with your current dataset.

---

# ✅ **Unsigned Score — Simplified (No Weighting Version)**

*A clean 0–10 score using raw signals only.*

---

# **1. Core Concept**

The score now comes from **four direct signal groups** with fixed points.
No multipliers.
No adjustments for recency or streams.
No hidden math.

This is the cleanest version to launch with a fresh database.

---

# **2. Signal Groups (Fixed Points Only)**

## **A. Discovery**

| Signal               | Points |
| -------------------- | ------ |
| Fresh Finds playlist | **+3** |

---

## **B. Publishing**

| Signal                  | Points                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| No publisher metadata   | **+3**                                                     |
| No administrator listed | **+1**                                                     |
| No IPI / ISWC           | **+1** (optional; can merge into “no publishing metadata”) |

---

## **C. Label / Distribution**

| Signal          | Points |
| --------------- | ------ |
| DIY distributor | **+2** |
| Indie label     | **+1** |
| Major label     | **–3** |

---

## **D. Metadata Completeness (9 fields)**

| Completeness | Points |
| ------------ | ------ |
| <25%         | **+4** |
| 25–49%       | **+3** |
| 50–74%       | **+2** |
| 75–100%      | **+1** |

Fields include:
ISRC, label, songwriter, publisher, admin, IPI, ISWC, streams, release date.

---

# **3. Portfolio-Level Signals (Still Simple)**

None of these use multipliers — just add them once:

| Portfolio Signal        | Points |
| ----------------------- | ------ |
| Majority DIY releases   | **+2** |
| At least 3 tracks found | **+2** |
| MusicBrainz profile     | **+1** |

---

# **4. Final Score Calculation (Straightforward)**

```
Total Score = Sum of ALL track signals + portfolio signals  
Final Score = Round(Clamp(Total Score, 0–10))
```

No weighting.
No recency adjustments.
No stream adjustments.
No averaging of duplicates — sum everything.

---

# **5. Why This Works for Phase 1**

### ✔ All your tracks are from the same period

So recency weighting = meaningless noise.

### ✔ Stream counts early on are misleading

Fresh Finds + early playlisting often yields inflated short-term streams.

### ✔ Keeps the system stable while data volume grows

You introduce weighting **later** when you have tracks from across months/years.

---

# **6. Optional (Phase 2 Later): Add Weighting Back**

When:

* database spans multiple months/years
* enough stream variance exists
* enough non-Fresh-Finds tracks exist

Then you reintroduce:

* recency weighting
* prominence weighting
* catalog stability weighting

But not now.

---

# ✔ **Ultra-Simple Tooltip Version (UI-Ready)**

```
Score ranks how likely a songwriter is unsigned based on playlist signals, publishing gaps, distribution type, and metadata completeness.
```

---

If you'd like, I can also produce:

* A **one-page version** for the team
* A **schema-ready version** for backend implementation
* A **UI explanation drawer** version for the Contact Profile

Just tell me which format you need next.
