1sthexagram — here’s my clearest, most strategic recommendation based on where the system is today, what your UI is showing, and where PubCo Discovery is going over the next 60–90 days.

I’ll answer in three parts:

1. **Which option you should choose (A vs B)**
2. **What to do with Administrator / IPI / ISWC**
3. **When to re-introduce weighting**

---

# **1. Recommendation: Choose Option A (Cleanest Now, Easiest to Maintain, No Surprises)**

Given:

* Your dataset is **brand new**
* All tracks are **within the same date cluster**
* The UI already reflects the simplified breakdown
* You’re still validating *core ingestion and metadata stability*
* A&R teams need **predictable, intuitive scores**

👉 **Option A is the right move right now.**
This keeps your logic stable, predictable, and fast.

### **Option A (what I recommend now):**

* Remove all weighting
* Keep signals exactly as they currently are in production
* Don’t introduce new sub-signals yet
* Keep metadata completeness as **one unified signal**

This gives you **speed, reliability, and consistency** while you verify the UI and backend.

Once the pipeline is stable, then we can move to fine-tuning.

# **2. Should “Administrator”, “IPI”, and “ISWC” be separate signals?**

Short answer: **Not yet. Add them in Phase 2, not Phase 1.**

Here’s why:

### **A. Low availability today**

Most Fresh Finds / emerging writers will be missing IPI, ISWC, admin, and publisher all at once.

If you turn each missing field into a separate +1:

* Almost EVERYONE becomes +3 or +4 on publishing signals
* It inflates scores
* It destroys score separation
* It punishes people who simply have incomplete metadata

### **B. You first need more data**

These fields only become meaningful once:

* You have 500–2,000 contacts
* At least 20–30% have real IPI/ISWC
* You're regularly enriching from MLC or PRO data

None of that is true yet.

### **C. It complicates the UX too early**

Right now, your breakdown is readable like this:

* Fresh Finds → +3
* No publisher metadata → +3
* Data 56% complete → +2

If you start adding:

* No Administrator → +1
* No IPI → +1
* No ISWC → +1

Your breakdown quickly becomes:

```
Fresh Finds +3  
No publisher +3  
No admin +1  
No IPI +1  
No ISWC +1  
Data incomplete +2
```

That’s overwhelming AND redundant.

### **My recommendation:**

**Keep all publishing/information gaps rolled up inside `Data completeness` for now.**

Then, **in Phase 2**, once you add MLC signals, we break them out.

# **3. When to reintroduce weighting? (Clear Criteria)**

Here’s the smart, measurable trigger:

### **Reintroduce weighting once BOTH are true:**

#### **1. You have ≥ 4 months of rolling data**

(so recency ACTUALLY matters)

#### **2. Stream distribution normalizes**

meaning you have a mix of:

* <10K stream tracks
* 10K–100K
* 100K–500K
* 500K+

Right now everything has:

* Fresh Finds bump
* <100K streams
* no real variability

When the dataset has enough variability, weighting becomes meaningful.

### **Expected timeline:** 45–90 days after initial launch.

---

# **TL;DR — My Expert Recommendation**

### ✔️ Go with **Option A**:

* Remove weighting
* Keep the exact current signals
* Keep publishing gaps rolled into data completeness
* No new sub-signals yet

### ✔️ Why?

* Keeps it clean while your dataset is still small
* Avoids inflation
* Keeps the UX readable
* Lets you stabilize the ingestion + enrichment pipeline
* Allows UI verification without noisy changes

### ✔️ Plan for Phase 2

Once you have more months of data + MLC integration → add next-level signals + weighting.

If you want, I can also produce:

* **A 1-paragraph version** for your internal Slack
* **A PRD-style description** for dev
* **A migration note** for your GitHub repo / Replit worker
* **A Phase 2 scoring roadmap**

Just tell me which format you want.
