# PubCo Discovery Engine — Updated Scoring Methodology (v1.0)

**Effective Immediately – November 2025**

---

## Overview

The PubCo Discovery Engine now uses a simplified **0–10 scoring system** to evaluate how likely a songwriter is **unsigned or unpublished**. This new approach removes all weighting multipliers and focuses on **clear, interpretable, fixed-point signals** that match our early-stage dataset.

This simplification improves accuracy, stability, and A&R usability. Scores are now predictable, transparent, and aligned with how metadata behaves for emerging writers.

---

## What the Score Measures

The score answers one central question:

> **“Is this songwriter likely unsigned or unpublished?”**

**Score Interpretation:**

* **8–10** → Strong unsigned/unpublished signal
* **5–7** → Mixed indicators
* **0–4** → Likely signed or published

No multipliers. No recency adjustments. No stream weighting. No decimals.

## Core Signal Groups (Fixed Points – Updated)

The current production scoring system evaluates five unique signal categories using **fixed point values** (no weighting, no multipliers). Below is the **single, correct table** for the active scoring system.

### **Scoring Table (Current Production System)**

| **Category**              | **Signal**                                                              | **Weight** | **Description**                                                                       |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Discovery**             | Fresh Finds playlist                                                    | **+3**     | Track appears on any Spotify Fresh Finds playlist.                                    |
| **Publishing**            | No publisher metadata                                                   | **+3**     | Missing publisher/admin/IPI/ISWC metadata on the track. Strong unpublished indicator. |
| **Label & Distribution**  | DIY distribution (DistroKid, Amuse, Ditto, CD Baby, TuneCore, "DK")     | **+2**     | Indicates unsigned or self-released eligibility.                                      |
| **Label & Distribution**  | Independent label                                                       | **+1**     | Label contains “independent” or similar non‑major identifiers.                        |
| **Label & Distribution**  | Major label detected (Sony, Warner, Universal, Atlantic, RCA, Columbia) | **−3**     | Strong indicator of major‑label backing.                                              |
| **Metadata Completeness** | Very incomplete (<25%)                                                  | **+4**     | Sparse metadata across 9 key fields.                                                  |
| **Metadata Completeness** | Incomplete (25–49%)                                                     | **+3**     | Limited metadata coverage.                                                            |
| **Metadata Completeness** | Partial (50–74%)                                                        | **+2**     | Moderate amount of metadata available.                                                |
| **Metadata Completeness** | Mostly complete (75–100%)                                               | **+1**     | High metadata completeness, typical of established creators.                          |
| **Portfolio Signals**     | Unsigned distribution pattern (>50% DIY/indie releases)                 | **+2**     | Track record of independent releases.                                                 |
| **Portfolio Signals**     | Unsigned peer pattern (>3 tracks found)                                 | **+2**     | Indicates active independent creator behavior.                                        |
| **Portfolio Signals**     | MusicBrainz profile found                                               | **+1**     | External identity verification.                                                       |

**Fields measured (9 total):** ISRC, label, songwriter, publisher, administrators, IPI number, ISWC, Spotify streams, release date.

## Score Calculation

### **Step 1 — Identify applicable signals**

Check the contact’s tracks and metadata across the three categories:

* Fresh Finds placement
* Publishing metadata completeness
* Metadata completeness bracket

### **Step 2 — Add fixed point values**

Example:

```
Fresh Finds playlist: +3
No publisher metadata: +3
Data 56% complete (partial): +2

Raw Total = 3 + 3 + 2 = 8
```

### **Step 3 — Cap and round to the 0–10 scale**

Final Score = **8/10**

No multipliers. No decimal calculations. No averaging of duplicate signals.

---

## Confidence Levels

Confidence communicates **data quality**, not unsigned certainty.

| Level      | Criteria                    |
| ---------- | --------------------------- |
| **High**   | ≥70% enriched AND ≥3 tracks |
| **Medium** | ≥40% enriched OR ≥2 tracks  |
| **Low**    | <40% enriched AND <2 tracks |

This ensures the A&R team understands how complete the underlying data is.

---

## Why We Simplified

### **A. Homogeneous Dataset (All Tracks ≈ Late 2025)**

Recency weighting would distort results because everything is clustered in the same timeframe.

### **B. Early Stream Counts Are Unreliable**

Fresh Finds inflates short-term streams, making prominence multipliers misleading.

### **C. A&R Usability**

The new system is instantly understandable—no formulas, no hidden math, no uncertainty.

### **D. Stability During Early Scaling**

Scores will not fluctuate unpredictably as we ingest more tracks.

## UI Changes (New Scoring Tab)

The Contact Drawer now includes a dedicated **Scoring** tab:

**Tabs (final order):**

1. Tracks
2. **Scoring**
3. Activity
4. Notes
5. Performance

Inside the Scoring tab, display:

```
Unsigned Score
8/10 — Medium Confidence

Summary:
"Strong unsigned signals. Fresh Finds placement and missing publishing metadata."

--- Discovery ---
Fresh Finds playlist                +3

--- Publishing ---
No publisher metadata               +3

--- Metadata Completeness ---
Data 56% complete (partial)         +2

Total: 3 + 3 + 2 = 8/10

Last updated: <timestamp>
```

No scoring content should appear in the header or other tabs.

---

## Phase 2 Enhancements (Future)

Once the dataset grows (6+ months of variance), we will reintroduce advanced scoring signals:

* **MLC integration:**

  * No MLC publisher: +3
  * Not found in MLC: +2
  * Partial publisher shares: +1
  * Fully published: –2

* **Publishing identity signals** (new standalone signals):

  * No Administrator
  * No IPI
  * No ISWC

* **Weighting multipliers** (recency + streams) once meaningful differentials appear.

These upgrades will allow differentiation between:

* Unsigned
* Unpublished
* Indie published
* Major published

---

## Summary

The simplified scoring system is:

* **Clear** — Easy for A&R to understand
* **Stable** — No noise from early metadata
* **Transparent** — All signals visible in the Scoring tab
* **Scalable** — Ready for MLC + future weighting when data volume increases

The new dedicated **Scoring Tab** provides a clean, grouped, and interpretable breakdown for every contact.
