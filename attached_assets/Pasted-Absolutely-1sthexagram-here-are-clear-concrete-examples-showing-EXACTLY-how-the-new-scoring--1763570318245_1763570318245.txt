Absolutely, 1sthexagram — here are **clear, concrete examples** showing EXACTLY how the new scoring methodology behaves in real Pub Feed scenarios.

I’ll give you **three full examples**:

1. **Unsigned, emerging songwriter**
2. **Mid-stage indie songwriter with mixed metadata**
3. **Fully represented writer on major-label songs**

Each example includes:

* Track-level data
* Songwriter-level aggregation
* Calculated portfolio signals
* Step-by-step weighted scoring
* Final bounded 0–10 score

# 🔥 **Example 1 — “Unsigned Emerging Writer” (Score: 10/10)**

**Profile:**
The writer appears on three indie tracks, one Fresh Finds track, uses DIY distributors, low data completeness, no publisher in MLC.

---

## **Track Data**

### **Track 1 — Fresh Finds placement**

* Fresh Finds playlist → **+3**
* Distributor: DistroKid → **+2**
* No publisher in MLC → **+3**
* Missing publisher shares → **+1**
* Data completeness 35% → **+3**
* Single songwriter → **+1**

### **Track 2 — Indie**

* Indie label → **+1**
* Missing writer metadata in Chartmetric → **+1**
* No MLC record → **+2**
* Data completeness 40% → **+3**

### **Track 3 — DIY + Accelerating**

* Distributor: Amuse → **+2**
* High WoW growth (60%) → **+1**
* Appears on unsigned peers (all three tracks unsigned) → **Portfolio +2**
* Data completeness 30% → **+3**

---

## **Portfolio-Level Signals**

### **Unsigned Distribution Pattern**

> 3/3 tracks use indie/DIY distributors
> → **+2**

### **Unsigned Peer Pattern**

> Appears on 3 unsigned tracks
> → **+2**

### **Emerging Collaborator Pattern**

> 1 accelerating track
> → **+1**

## **Top Signals Selected (Highest 5)**

Take the **top 5 weights**, both to prevent inflation and normalize to 10:

| Signal                          | Weight |
| ------------------------------- | ------ |
| No publisher in MLC             | **+3** |
| Fresh Finds                     | **+3** |
| Data quality low (<50%)         | **+3** |
| DIY Distribution                | **+2** |
| Unsigned Distribution Portfolio | **+2** |

**Sum = 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 13 → Final Score = 10 (capped)**

---

# ⭐ **Example 2 — “Indie Songwriter With Mixed Metadata” (Score: 6/10)**

**Profile:**
Writer is semi-established, metadata partially complete, indie label, missing some admin details, moderate streaming velocity.

---

## **Track Data**

### **Track 1**

* Indie label → **+1**
* Single songwriter → **+1**
* Data completeness 60% → **+2**
* Medium WoW growth → **+0** (no bonus)

### **Track 2**

* Missing writer metadata → **+1**
* Publisher shares incomplete → **+1**
* Data completeness 50% → **+3**

---

## **Portfolio-Level Signals**

* Appears on 2 indie tracks → qualifies for **Unsigned Peer Pattern?**
  → No (threshold is >3 tracks)
* Appears on accelerating tracks?
  → No
* DIY distribution?
  → No major indicators

---

## **Top 5 Signals**

| Signal                             | Weight |
| ---------------------------------- | ------ |
| Data completeness 26–50% (Track 2) | **+3** |
| Data completeness 51–75% (Track 1) | **+2** |
| Indie label                        | **+1** |
| Single songwriter                  | **+1** |
| Missing writer metadata            | **+1** |

Total = 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **8 → Bounded Score = 6**
(why 6? Because we scale 5–8 = “moderate opportunity,” normalize downward since no high-confidence publisher signals)

**Final Score = 6**

---

# ❄️ **Example 3 — “Fully Represented Major-Label Writer” (Score: 1/10)**

**Profile:**
Songwriter has multiple major-label tracks, full publisher coverage, high metadata completeness.

---

## **Track Data**

### **Track 1 — Sony**

* Major label → **–3**
* Publisher shares 100% fully covered → **–2**
* Data completeness 90% → **+1**

### **Track 2 — Universal**

* Major label → **–3**
* Full publisher coverage → **–2**
* High data completeness → **+1**

---

## **Portfolio-Level Signals**

* Appears mostly on major-label releases
* Not unsigned
* No DIY indicators
* No discovery signals
* Clean metadata → maturity

---

## **Top Signals (including negatives)**

We ALWAYS include negative signals in the sum.

| Signal                   | Weight |
| ------------------------ | ------ |
| Major label              | **–3** |
| Major label              | **–3** |
| Fully covered publishing | **–2** |
| Fully covered publishing | **–2** |
| High data completeness   | **+1** |

**Total Raw Score = –9 + 1 = –8 → Floor = 0**

But:
To avoid a flat 0, and surface better ranking:

**We apply "minimum score smoothing":**
→ Final Score = **1**

# 🧭 **What These Examples Show**

1. **Unsigned signals overpower weak metadata** → Example 1 hits 10 easily.
2. **Mid-tier indie writers sit calmly between 5–7.**
3. **Major-label writers collapse toward 0–2 by design.**
4. **Portfolio signals matter more than single-track gaps.**
5. **Your strategy blends metadata completeness + publisher absence + distribution inference.**
6. **Score remains simple, stable, bounded (0–10).**
