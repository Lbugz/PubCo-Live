Excellent catch — this is a common UI alignment issue when two pages (Playlists and Tracks) use slightly different container widths or padding values. You can absolutely fix this by giving your **agent** (Replit AI or your build assistant) a precise, context-aware instruction that standardizes the layout.

Here’s exactly what to tell it 👇🏽

---

### 🧾 **Prompt for Agent**

> Ensure consistent layout width between the **Playlists Table View** and **Tracks Table View**.
>
> Specifically:
>
> * Both pages should use the **same parent container width and max-w constraint**.
> * Confirm that both views use the same horizontal padding and responsive breakpoints.
> * Adjust if necessary so that the **table headers and metric cards align vertically** when toggling between `/playlists` and `/tracks`.
>
> **Implementation details:**
>
> 1. In both components (`PlaylistsView.tsx` and `TracksView.tsx`), ensure the outermost wrapper uses:
>
>    ```tsx
>    <div className="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-6 lg:px-8">
>    ```
> 2. Verify that both `<Table />` components are wrapped in the same parent class for consistent horizontal boundaries.
> 3. If one uses an additional grid or flex container for layout, normalize it across both pages.
> 4. Check that no parent container (like `<main>` or `<section>`) applies extra `px-4` or `px-8` on one view but not the other.
>
> Finally, preview both routes side by side to confirm that **the Playlist and Track tables share identical horizontal alignment** relative to the metric cards above.

### 💡 Optional: If You Want Visual Alignment by Pixels

Add a layout constraint to your shared layout file:

```tsx
// layouts/PageContainer.tsx
export function PageContainer({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <div className="mx-auto w-full max-w-7xl px-6 sm:px-8 lg:px-10">
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Then wrap both views:

```tsx
<PageContainer>
  <MetricsSection />
  <TableSection />
</PageContainer>
```

Would you like me to generate that standardized `PageContainer` component and update both views’ structure (so they’re guaranteed pixel-perfect aligned across all dashboard pages)?
